    <h1>What Is the Difference Between <a href="https://www.codingSCHOOL.com/catalog/language/html-css">HTML and CSS?</a> </h1>
    <p> <b> 1- The main difference between HTML and CSS is that while HTML defines the structure of web pages, CSS is used to style those pages with a variety of different features. If we think of HTML code as the skeleton of a web page, CSS would be its skin.</b></p>
    <h2> <mark> Other differences between <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML </a> and CSS include:</mark></h2>
    <h4> 2- 
        <u>HTML consists of text contained within HTML tags</u>, while <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css">CSS</a> is made up of declaration blocks and selectors Where HTML gives a web browser display information of various tags,
         <br> 
         <u>CSS enhances that information to the browser</u> by adding styling to those HTML tags
         <br>
        <u>CSS can be used inside an HTML document</u>, but HTML cannot be used inside a CSS sheet
        <br>
        <u>CSS is used for presentation and visual effect</u> — to manipulate colors, fonts, and backgrounds, add visual style to sites, prepare images, specify margins and borders, and much more — while HTML is not

    <p>
        <mark>Coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called programs,</mark> that computers can follow to perform tasks. It involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or more programming languages. Programmers typically use high-level programming languages that are more easily intelligible to humans than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. Proficient programming usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, details of programming languages and generic code libraries, specialized algorithms, and formal logic. Auxiliary tasks accompanying and related to programming include analyzing requirements, testing, debugging (investigating and fixing problems), implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as programs' machine code.

        While these are sometimes considered programming, often the term software development is used for this larger overall process — with the terms programming, implementation, and coding reserved for the writing and editing of code per se. <mark>Sometimes software development is known as software engineering</mark>, especially when it employs formal methods or follows an engineering design process.

        The first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. However, Charles Babbage had already written his first program for the Analytical Engine in 1837.

        In the 1880s, Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form. Later a control panel (plug board) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs, and by the late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by control panels in a similar way, as were the first electronic computers. However, with the concept of the stored-program computer introduced in 1949, both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in computer memory.

        Programming is, quite literally, all around us. From the take-out we order, to the movies we stream, code enables everyday actions in our lives. Tech companies are no longer recognizable as just software companies — instead, they bring food to our door, help us get a taxi, influence outcomes in presidential elections, or act as a personal trainer.
