    <h1>Petra</h1>
    <p>
        Inhabited since prehistoric times, this <b>Nabataean</b> 
         caravan-city, situated between the Red Sea and the <b>Dead Sea,</b> 
         was an important crossroads between Arabia, Egypt, and Syria-Phoenicia.
          Petra is half-built, half-carved into the rock, and is surrounded 
          by mountains riddled with passages and gorges. It is one of the 
          world's most famous archaeological sites, where ancient <b>Eastern</b> 
         traditions blend with <b>Hellenistic</b>  architecture.
